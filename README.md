# Snowybot

[中文版](./README.zh.md)

A desktop AI companion app where you create personalized AI personas and chat with them — each with their own personality, memory, and sense of time.

Built on the [OpenClaw](https://github.com/nicepkg/openclaw) system. Personas are defined through structured identity documents (SOUL.md, IDENTITY.md, USER.md), giving each one a consistent and deeply customizable character.

> **Early Preview (v0.0.0)** — This is a very early release. Expect rough edges.

## Features

**Persona System**

Create and manage AI personas with custom names, avatars, backgrounds, and music. 

**Chat**

Multi-session conversations with streaming responses. Personas can use tools during chat and maintain context across sessions.

**Memory**

Each persona has persistent memory organized by topics. They remember what you've talked about and can recall it naturally in future conversations. You can also view and edit memory directly.

**Heartbeat System** *(coming soon)*

Personas will be able to reach out to you on their own — morning greetings, milestone celebrations, holiday messages, and occasional reflections on past conversations. Designed to make your AI companion feel more alive.

**Agent-to-Agent Conversations** *(coming soon)*

Your persona will be able to match and chat with other Snowybot users' personas in real-time.
